NeuralPy is a High-Level [Keras](https://keras.io/) like deep learning library that works on top of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) written in pure Python. NeuralPy can be used to develop state-of-the-art deep learning models in a few lines of code. It provides a Keras like simple yet powerful interface to build and train models.

Here are some highlights of NeuralPy

- Provides an easy interface that is suitable for fast prototyping, learning, and research
- Can run on both CPU and GPU
- Works on top of PyTorch
- Cross-Compatible with PyTorch models

## PyTorch

PyTorch is an open-source machine learning framework that accelerates the path from research prototyping to production deployment developed by Facebook runs on both CPU and GPU.

According to Wikipedia,

> PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library based on the Torch library, used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing, primarily developed by Facebook's AI Research lab (FAIR). It is free and open-source software released under the Modified BSD license.

NeuralPy is a high-level library that works on top of PyTorch. As it works on top of PyTorch, NerualPy supports both CPU and GPU and can perform numerical operations very efficiently.

If you want to learn more about PyTorch, then please check the [PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/).
