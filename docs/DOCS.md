# Introduction
NeuralPy is a Keras like, deep learning library that works on top of PyTorch written purely in Python. It is a simple, easy to use library that is cross-compatible with PyTorch models and suitable for all kinds of machine learning experiments, learning, research, etc.

## PyTorch in NeuralPy
PyTorch is an open-source machine learning framework that accelerates the path from research prototyping to production deployment developed by Facebook runs on both CPU and GPU.

Following are some highlights of PyTorch:
- Production Ready
- Distributed Training
- Robust Ecosystem
- Cloud Support

NeuralPy is a high-level library that works on top of PyTorch. It provides easy to use, powerful and interactive APIs that can be used to build state-of-the-art models. As it works on top of PyTorch, NeuralPy supports both CPU and GPU and can perform numerical operations very efficiently.

Here are some highlights of NeuralPy:
- Provides an easy interface that is suitable for fast prototyping, learning, and research
- Works on top of PyTorch
- Can run on both CPU and GPU
- Cross-Compatible with PyTorch models
  
## Get Started with NeuralPy
Let’s get started with NeuralPy. The first step is to install NeuralPy, but before installing NeuralPy, we need to install some additional dependencies.

### Prerequisites 
NeuralPy runs on Python 3.6+, so first install Python 3. Please check the python documentation for installation instructions. After that install PyTorch and Numpy. For instructions, please check their official documentation and installation guides.

> NeuralPy runs on Python 3.6+, there is no version for Python 2

### Installation
To install NeuralPy run the following command on terminal.
```bash
pip install neuralpy-torch
```
If you have multiple versions of python, then you might need to use pip3.

```bash
pip3 install neuralpy-torch
//or
python3 -m pip install neuralpy-torch
```

### First Model
Here, in this example, we’ll create a simple linear regression model. The model accepts X (independent variable) and predicts the y(dependent variable). The model basically learns the relation between X and y. 

#### Dataset for the model
Here we’ll create some synthetic data for our model, we’ll use numpy to generate random numbers.

```python
# Importing dependencies
import numpy as np

# Random seed for numpy
np.random.seed(1969)

# Generating the data
# Training data
X_train = np.random.rand(100, 1) * 10
y_train = X_train + 5 * np.random.rand(100, 1)

# Validation data
X_validation = np.random.rand(100, 1) * 10
y_validation = X_validation + 5 * np.random.rand(100, 1)

# Test data
X_test = np.random.rand(100, 1) * 10
y_test = X_test + 5 * np.random.rand(100, 1)
```

#### Importing dependencies from NeuralPy
Let’s import the dependencies from NeuralPy. 

Here we’ll use the Sequential model. Sequential is basically a linear stack of layers. Dense as a layer, Adam as an optimizer and MSELoss for calculating the loss.

```python
from neuralpy.models import Sequential
from neuralpy.layers import Dense
from neuralpy.optimizer import Adam
from neuralpy.loss_functions import MSELoss
```

#### Making the model
Sequential provides an easy .add() method to add layers in the sequential model. We’ll use it to build the model.

```python
# Making the model
model = Sequential()

# Adding the layer
model.add(Dense(n_nodes=1, n_inputs=1))
```

#### Building the model
Once the model architecture is ready, we can build the model. This build method a PyTorch model internally.

```python
# Building the model
model.build()
```

#### Compiling the model
Once the model architecture is ready, we can compile with the optimizer and loss function. NeuralPy models provide an easy compile method for that. We just need to pass the optimizer and loss function in the compile method. It also accepts a metrics parameter, for this case, we don't need it.

```python
# Compiling the model
model.compile(optimizer=Adam(), loss_function=MSELoss())
```

#### Training the model
To train, we have the fit method. We need to pass the training and validation data, along with some other parameters to the fit method.

```python
model.fit(train_data=(X_train, y_train), test_data=(X_validation, y_validation), epochs=300, batch_size=4)
```

#### Predicting Results
Main purpose of the model is to predict results. In NeuralPy models, there are two methods for prediction,  `.predict()` and `.predict_classes()`. Here for this linear regression problem, we'll use the `.predict()` method.

```python
# Predicting
preds = model.predict(X=X_test, batch_size=4)
```

#### Evaluating the models
After training, one important step is to evaluate the model on the test dataset. To do that, we have, in NeuralPy, we have a `.evaluate()` method.

```python
# Evaluating
ev = model.evaluate(X=X_test, y=y_test, batch_size=4)
```

# Layers

```python
neuralpy.layers
```
Layers are the building blocks of a Neural Network. A complete Neural Network model consists of several layers. A Layer is a function that receives a tensor as output, computes something out of it, and finally outputs another transformed tensor.

NeuralPy currently supports only one type of Layer and that is the Dense layer. 

## Dense Layer
```python
neuralpy.layers.Dense(n_nodes, n_inputs=None, bias=True, name=None)
```
A Dense is a normal densely connected Neural Network. It performs a linear transformation of the input.

To learn more about Dense layers, please check [pytorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html?highlight=linear#torch.nn.Linear) for it.

# Advanced Topics

NeuralPy is limited because there are limited types of Layers, Loss Functions, Optimizers, Regulariziers, etc, in NeuralPy.

But there are times when we might need a layer, or an optimizer, or a loss function for a model that is not implemented on NeuralPy.

In NeuralPy, anyone can build a custom Layer, Optimizer, Loss Function, Regularizer, etc.

## Building a Custom Layer

NeuralPy is based on PyTorch, so first we need to build PyTorch valid layer, or use some existing PyTorch layer. To get a list of Layers implemented by PyTorch, check [this](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html) page.

> The PyTorch layer needed to be a class-based layer, functional PyTorch layers are not supported by NeuralPy.

> Also if you want to build your own custom PyTorch layer, then please check [this](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-build-your-own-pytorch-neural-network-layer-from-scratch-2x6136th) medium article.

#### So now let's start coding

First import the PyTorch layer class that you want to use in NeuralPy. If you are using a custom PyTorch layer, then import that.

In the example below, We'll use the [Flatten](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#flatten) layer, This layer already is implemented by PyTorch. So importing it from the `nn` module.

```python
from torch.nn import Flatten as _Flatten
...
# Rest of the imports
...
```

After that, create a class with two public methods `get_input_dim` and `get_layer`. Along with that create an `__init__` method also.

```python
class Flatten:
    def __init__(self):
       pass

    def get_input_dim(self, prev_input_dim):
       pass

    def get_layer(self):
       pass
```

Here the `__init__` method is for setting up the layer. Pass all the parameters that you need for the layer, like input share, output shape, etc.

The `get_input_dim` method is used for calculating input shape based on the output shape of the previous layer. If your layer does not have an input shape, then just return `None`.

The `get_layer` method is the most important layer and it returns a dictionary with all the details that NeuralPy Model class needs for building the model.

```python
class Flatten:
    def __init__(self, start_dim=1, end_dim=-1, name):
	# Validate the parameters

	# Checking the name field, this is an optional field,
	# if not provided generates a unique name for the layer
        if name is not None and not (isinstance(name, str) and name):
            raise ValueError("Please provide a valid name")

	    self.__start_dim = start_dim
	    self.__end_dim = end_dim
	    self.__name = name

    def get_input_dim(self, prev_input_dim):

        # As there is no input shape, returning None
        return None

    def get_layer(self):
        return {
             'n_inputs': None,
             'n_nodes': None,
             'name': self.__name,
             'type': 'Flatten',
             'layer': _Flatten,
             'keyword_arguments': {
                 'start_dim': self.__start_dim,
                 'end_dim': self.__end_dim
              }
        }
```
If you check the PyTorch docs, then Flatten accepts two parameters, `start_dim` and `end_dim`. So in the `__init__` method, I've added these two parameters, along with the `name` parameter. NeuralPy needs a name for every layer, if there is no name provided, then auto generates a layer name.

Flatten does not have an input shape parameter, `get_input_dim` method just returns `None`.

Finally, the `get_layer` method returns a dictionary with several fields. Here is the detail of all the fields.

- `n_inputs`: Pass the input shape of the layer, in the next layer, you'll get this field as `prev_input_dim` parameter in the `get_input_dim`.

- `n_nodes`: Is the output dim of the layer

- `type`: Type of the layer, just pass the layer name in a string. This is used to auto-generate layer name

- `name`: Pass the name parameter

- `keyword_arguments`: It contains a dictionary of all the parameters that the PyTorch layer or your custom layer accepts. If there is no parameter for the layer, send set it as None. For our `Flatten` layer, we need to pass the `start_dim` and `end_dim`.  

> We can create Activation Functions, Regulariziers using the same above method also.

- [Dropout](https://github.com/imdeepmind/NeuralPy/blob/master/neuralpy/regulariziers/dropout.py)

## Building a custom Optimizer
Steps for making a custom Optimizer is mostly similar to making a custom Layer. So first we need to import a PyTorch optimizer or use a custom PyTorch compatible optimizer.

Create a class with one public method `get_optimizer` and an `__init__` method.

```python
from torch.optim import SGD as _SGD

class SGD:
	def __init__(self):
		pass
	
	def get_optimizer(self):
		pass
```

Then in the `__init__` method pass all the parameters that is needed for the optimizer.

In the `get_optimizer` method returns a dictionary with all the details that is needed by the NeuralPy Models.

```python
from torch.optim import SGD as _SGD

class SGD:
    def __init__(self, learning_rate=0.001, momentum=0.0,
                 dampening=0.0, weight_decay=0.0, nesterov=False):

        # Validation the input fields
        if not isinstance(learning_rate, float) or learning_rate < 0.0:
            raise ValueError("Invalid learning_rate")

        if not isinstance(momentum, float) or momentum < 0.0:
            raise ValueError("Invalid momentum value")

        if not isinstance(weight_decay, float) or weight_decay < 0.0:
            raise ValueError("Invalid weight_decay value")

        if not isinstance(dampening, float):
            raise ValueError("Invalid dampening parameter")

        if not isinstance(nesterov, bool):
            raise ValueError("Invalid nesterov parameter")

        self.__learning_rate = learning_rate
        self.__momentum = momentum
        self.__dampening = dampening
        self.__weight_decay = weight_decay
        self.__nesterov = nesterov

    def get_optimizer(self):
        # Returning the optimizer data
        return {
            'optimizer': _SGD,
            'keyword_arguments': {
                'lr': self.__learning_rate,
                'momentum': self.__momentum,
                'dampening': self.__dampening,
                'weight_decay': self.__weight_decay,
                'nesterov': self.__nesterov
            }
        }
```

Here the `get_optimizer` is similar to the `get_layer` method. Just returns a dictionary with all the data. The `optimizer` in the dictionary is the main optimizer and the `keyword_arguments` contains all the arguments for the PyTorch SGD optimizer.



## Building a custom Loss Function
Steps for making a custom Loss Function is also mostly similar to making a custom Layer. So first we need to import a PyTorch loss function or use a custom PyTorch compatible loss function.

Create a class with one public method `get_loss_function` and an `__init__` method.

```python
from torch.nn import MSELoss as _MSELoss

class SGD:
	def __init__(self):
		pass
	
	def get_loss_function(self):
		pass
```

Then in the `__init__` method pass all the parameters that are needed for the optimizer.

In the `get_loss_function` method returns a dictionary with all the details that are needed by the NeuralPy Models.

```python
from torch.nn import MSELoss as _MSELoss

class MSELoss:
    def __init__(self, reduction='mean'):
        if reduction not in ["none", "mean", "sum"]:
            raise ValueError("Invalid reduction")
           
        self.__reduction = reduction

    def get_loss_function(self):
        return {
            'loss_function': _MSELoss,
            'keyword_arguments': {
                'reduction': self.__reduction
            }
        }
```

Here the `get_loss_function` is similar to the `get_layer` method. Just returns a dictionary with all the data. The `loss_function`  field in the dictionary is the main loss function and the `keyword_arguments` contains all the arguments for the PyTorch MSE Loss Function.
