# Dropout3D

```python
neuralpy.layers.regularizers.Dropout3D(p=0.5, name=None)
```

:::info

Dropout3D is mostly stable and can be used for any project. In the future, any chance of breaking changes is very low.

:::

Applies the Dropout3D layer to the input tensor.

The Dropout3D layer randomly sets entire channel units to 0 with a frequency of rate of `p` at each step during training time. It helps prevent overfitting.

Usually the input comes from `nn.Conv3D`modules.

For more information, check [this](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#dropout3d) page

## Supported Arguments

- `p=0.5`: (Float) Probability of an element to be zeroed. The value should be between 0.0 and 1.0.
- `name=None`: (String) Name of the layer, if not provided then automatically calculates a unique name for the layer

## Example Code

```python
from neuralpy.models import Sequential
from neuralpy.layers.regularizers import Dropout3D

# Initializing the Sequential models
model = Sequential()
...
...
...

model.add(Dropout3D(p=0.5, name="MyDropoutLayer"))
```
