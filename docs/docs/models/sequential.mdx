## Sequential

```python
neuralpy.models.Sequential(force_cpu=False, training_device=None, random_state=None)
```

:::info

NeuralPy Sequential Model Class is mostly stable and can be used for any project. In the future, any chance of breaking changes is very low.

:::

Sequential is a linear stack of layers with single input and output layer. It is one of the simplest types of models. In Sequential models, each layer has a single input and output tensor.

> The Sequential model works on top of Model class, so all the methods that are available on the Model is also available here in Sequential class

### Supported Arguments

- `force_cpu=False`: (Boolean) If True, then uses CPU even if CUDA is available
- `training_device=None`: (NeuralPy device class) Device that will be used for training predictions
- `random_state`: (Integer) Random state for the device

### Supported Methods

#### `.add()` method:

In a Sequential model, the `.add()` method is responsible for adding a new layer to the model. It accepts a NeuralPy layer class as an argument and builds a model, and based on that. The .add() method can be called as many times as needed. There is no limitation on that, assuming you have enough computation power to handle it.

##### Supported Arguments

- `layer`: (NeuralPy layer classes) Adds a layer into the model

##### Example Codes

```python
from neuralpy.models import Sequential
from neuralpy.layers.linear import Dense
from neuralpy.layers.activation_functions import ReLU
from neuralpy import device

# Setting a training device
training_device = device('cpu')

# Initializing the Sequential models
model = Sequential(force_cpu=False, training_device=training_device, random_state=1969)

# Adding layers to the model
model.add(Dense(n_nodes=3, n_inputs=5, bias=True))
model.add(ReLU())
model.add(Dense(n_nodes=3, n_inputs=3, bias=True))
```

#### `.build()` method:

In a Sequential model, the `.build()` method is responsible for building the PyTorch model from the NeuralPy model.

After finishing the architecture of the model, the model needed to be built before training.

##### Supported Arguments:

- There is no argument for this model

#### Example Code

```python
from neuralpy.models import Sequential
...
# Rest of the imports
...

model = Sequential()
...
# Model Architecture
...

# Calling .build to build the model
model.build()
```
