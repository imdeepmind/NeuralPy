# MSE Loss

```python
neuralpy.loss_functions.MSELoss(reduction='mean')
```

Applies a Mean Squared Error loss function to the model.

For more information, check [this](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#mseloss) page.

## Supported Arguments

- `reduction='mean'` : (String) Specifies the reduction that is to be applied to the output.

## Code Example

```python
from neuralpy.models import Sequential
from neuralpy.optimizer import Adam
from neuralpy.loss_functions import MSELoss
...
# Rest of the imports
...

model = Sequential()
...
# Rest of the architecture
...
# Compiling the model
model.compile(optimizer=Adam(), loss_function=MSELoss(reduction='mean'))
```
