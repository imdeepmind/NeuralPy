# BCE Loss

```python
neuralpy.loss_functions.BCELoss(weight=None, reduction='mean', pos_weight=None)
```

Applies a BCE Loss function to the model.

> BCE Loss automatically applies a Sigmoid Layer at the end of the model, so there is no need to add a Sigmoid layer.

For more information, check [this](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#bcewithlogitsloss) page.

## Supported Arguments

- `weight=None` : (Numpy Array | List) Manual rescaling of classes
- `reduction='mean'` : (String) Specifies the reduction that is to be applied to the output.
- `post_weight=None` : (Numpy Array | List) A weight of positive examples

## Code Example

```python
from neuralpy.models import Sequential
from neuralpy.optimizer import Adam
from neuralpy.loss_functions import BCELoss
...
# Rest of the imports
...

model = Sequential()
...
# Rest of the architecture
...

model.compile(optimizer=Adam(), loss_function=BCELoss(weight=None, reduction='mean', pos_weight=None))
```
