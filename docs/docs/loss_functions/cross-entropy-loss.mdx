# Cross Entropy Loss

```python
neuralpy.loss_functions.CrossEntropyLoss(weight=None, ignore_index=-100 reduction='mean')
```

Applies a Cross-Entropy Loss function to the model.

> Cross-Entropy Loss automatically applies a Softmax Layer at the end of the model, so there is no need to add a Softmax layer.

For more information, check [this](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#crossentropyloss) page.

## Supported Arguments

- `weight=None` : (Numpy Array | List) Manual rescaling of classes
- `ignore_index=-100` : (Integer) Specifies a target value that is ignored and does not contribute to the input gradient.
- `reduction='mean'` : (String) Specifies the reduction that is to be applied to the output.

## Code Example

```python
import numpy as np
from neuralpy.models import Sequential
from neuralpy.optimizer import Adam
from neuralpy.loss_functions import BCELoss
...
# Rest of the imports
...

model = Sequential()
...
# Rest of the architecture
...
# Weight of different classes, here 3 is the number of classes
weight = np.ones([3])

model.compile(optimizer=Adam(), loss_function=CrossEntropyLoss(weight=weight, reduction='mean', pos_weight=None))
```
