## AlphaDropout

```python
neuralpy.regularizers.AlphaDropout(p=0.5, name=None)
```

Applies Alpha Dropout over the input.

For more information, check [this](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#alphadropout) page

### Supported Arguments

- `p=0.5`: (Float) Probability of an element to be zeroed. The value should be between 0.0 and 1.0.
- `name=None`: (String) Name of the layer, if not provided then automatically calculates a unique name for the layer

### Example Code

```python
from neuralpy.models import Sequential
from neuralpy.regularizers import AlphaDropout

# Initializing the Sequential models
model = Sequential()
...
...
...

model.add(AlphaDropout(p=0.5, name="MyDropoutLayer"))
```
