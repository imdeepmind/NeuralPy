## Dropout2D

```python
neuralpy.regularizers.Dropout2D(p=0.5, name=None)
```

Applies the Dropout2D layer to the input tensor.

The Dropout2D layer randomly sets entire channel units to 0 with a frequency of rate of `p` at each step during training time. It helps prevent overfitting.

Usually the input comes from `nn.Conv2D` modules.

For more information, check [this](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#dropout2d) page

###  Supported Arguments

- `p=0.5`: (Float) Probability of an element to be zeroed. The value should be between 0.0 and 1.0.
- `name=None`: (String) Name of the layer, if not provided then automatically calculates a unique name for the layer

### Example Code

```python
from neuralpy.models import Sequential
from neuralpy.regularizers import Dropout2D

# Initializing the Sequential models
model = Sequential()
...
...
...

model.add(Dropout2D(p=0.5, name="MyDropoutLayer"))
```
