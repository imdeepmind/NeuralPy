# TrainLogger

```python
neuralpy.callbacks.TrainLogger(path=None)
```

TrainLogger is a NeuralPy Callback class that generates training logs. It generates CSV files of training logs with all the parameters, other model configuration, and the model loss accuracy.

## Supported Arguments

    - `path`: (String)  Directory where the logs will be stored

## Example Code

```python
from neuralpy.models import Sequential
...
...
...
from neuralpy.callbacks import TrainLogger

model = Sequential()
...
...
...

logger = TrainLogger("logs/")

# Here the fit method accepts callbacks as array
history = model.fit(train_data=(X_train, y_train), validation_data=(X_validation, y_validation), epochs=2, batch_size=32, callbacks=[logger])
```
