# Installation

NeuralPy runs on Python 3.6+, so first install Python 3. Please check the python documentation for installation instructions.

Once Python is ready, PyTorch and Numpy needed to be installed. For instructions, please check their official documentation and installation guides.

> NeuralPy runs on Python 3.6+, there is no version for Python 2

To install NeuralPy run the following command on terminal.

```bash
pip install neuralpy-torch
```

If you have multiple versions of python, then you might need to use pip3.

```bash
pip3 install neuralpy-torch
//or
python3 -m pip install neuralpy-torch
```
