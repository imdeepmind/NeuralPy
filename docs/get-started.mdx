# Get Started

Here, in this example, we’ll create a simple linear regression model. The model accepts X (independent variable) and predicts the y(dependent variable). The model basically learns the relation between X and y.

## Dataset for the model

Here we’ll create some synthetic data for our model, we’ll use numpy to generate random numbers.

```python
# Importing dependencies
import numpy as np

# Random seed for numpy
np.random.seed(1969)

# Generating the data
# Training data
X_train = np.random.rand(100, 1) * 10
y_train = X_train + 5 * np.random.rand(100, 1)

# Validation data
X_validation = np.random.rand(100, 1) * 10
y_validation = X_validation + 5 * np.random.rand(100, 1)

# Test data
X_test = np.random.rand(100, 1) * 10
y_test = X_test + 5 * np.random.rand(100, 1)
```

## Importing dependencies from NeuralPy

Let’s import the dependencies from NeuralPy.

Here we’ll use the Sequential model. Sequential is basically a linear stack of layers. Dense as a layer, Adam as an optimizer and MSELoss for calculating the loss.

```python
from neuralpy.models import Sequential
from neuralpy.layers import Dense
from neuralpy.optimizer import Adam
from neuralpy.loss_functions import MSELoss
```

## Making the model

Sequential provides an easy .add() method to add layers in the sequential model. We’ll use it to build the model.

```python
# Making the model
model = Sequential()

# Adding the layer
model.add(Dense(n_nodes=1, n_inputs=1))
```

## Building the model

Once the model architecture is ready, we can build the model. This build method a PyTorch model internally.

```python
# Building the model
model.build()
```

## Compiling the model

Once the model architecture is ready, we can compile with the optimizer and loss function. NeuralPy models provide an easy compile method for that. We just need to pass the optimizer and loss function in the compile method. It also accepts a metrics parameter, for this case, we don't need it.

```python
# Compiling the model
model.compile(optimizer=Adam(), loss_function=MSELoss())
```

## Training the model

To train, we have the fit method. We need to pass the training and validation data, along with some other parameters to the fit method.

```python
model.fit(train_data=(X_train, y_train), test_data=(X_validation, y_validation), epochs=300, batch_size=4)
```

## Predicting Results

Main purpose of the model is to predict results. In NeuralPy models, there are two methods for prediction, `.predict()` and `.predict_classes()`. Here for this linear regression problem, we'll use the `.predict()` method.

```python
# Predicting
preds = model.predict(X=X_test, batch_size=4)
```

## Evaluating the models

After training, one important step is to evaluate the model on the test dataset. To do that, we have, in NeuralPy, we have a `.evaluate()` method.

```python
# Evaluating
ev = model.evaluate(X=X_test, y=y_test, batch_size=4)
```
