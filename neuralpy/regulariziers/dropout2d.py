"""Dropout Layer"""

from torch.nn import Dropout as _Dropout2d

class Dropout2D:
    """
        Applies Dropout2D to the input.

        The Dropout2D layer randomly sets input units to 0 with a frequency of `rate`
        at each step during training time, which helps prevent overfitting.
        Inputs not set to 0 are scaled up by 1/(1 - rate)
        such that the sum over all inputs is unchanged.

        Supported Arguments
            p=0.5: (Float) Probability of an element to be zeroed.
                    The value should be between 0.0 and 1.0.
