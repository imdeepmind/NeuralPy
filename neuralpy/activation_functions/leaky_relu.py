class LeakyReLU:
    """
        LeakyReLU is a modified ReLU activation function with some improvements.
        LeakyReLU solves the problem of "dead ReLU", by introducing a new parameter
        called the negative slope.

        In traditional ReLU, if the input is negative, then the output is 0.
        But for LeakyReLU, the output is not zero. This feature special behavior
        of LeakyReLU solves the problem of "dead ReLU" and helps in learning.
